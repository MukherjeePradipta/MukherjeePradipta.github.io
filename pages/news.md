**January 2025:**  
Pradipta was invited to give a talk on "Dynamic Optical Coherence Tomography: Visualizing 3D Tissue Dynamics Without Labeling" at an [international workshop on Recent Trends in Electromagnetics and Optics](https://workshoprteop2025.iiests.ac.in/), organized by IIEST Shibpur.

**September 2024:**  
Sufia joined our group as a project assistant after completing her M.Sc. in Biophysics from Jamia Millia Islamia. In her Master's dissertation, she worked on a biophysical approach to studying Parkinson's disease. 

**September 2024:**  
Pradipta gave a talk titled "Label-free dynamic tomographic microscopy for tissue functional imaging" as part of the CBME Achiever's Talk Series. 
The session was attended by CBME students and faculty members.

**July 2024:**  
Abritty joined the BioPhotonica Lab as a PhD student. 
Let's welcome her! 
Abritty completed her integrated M.Sc. in Bioscience from IISC Bangalore and qualified for the CSIR-NET (JRF) twice, in 2021 and 2023. 
Prior to joining our lab, she worked as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF).....
Her research interests include optical coherence tomography, retinal imaging, and animal model studies. 

**February 2024:**  
Pradipta joined the Centre for Biomedical Engineering at IIT Delhi as an Assistant Professor and established the BioPhotonica Lab.
