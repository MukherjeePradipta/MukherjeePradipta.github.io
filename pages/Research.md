Our group is interested in developing next-generation medical devices and computational tools to assess complex biological processes within intricate biological systems non-invasively and label-free. Through advanced engineering, we aim to achieve deeper tissue penetration, faster acquisition times, multi-functional contrasts, and automated high-throughput visualization of biological systems. These advancements will propel our understanding of biological systems and enhance the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
Our current research interests are the following: 
- **Label-free imaging**
- **Multi-functional optical coherence tomography**
- **Quantitative Polarization Microscopy**
- **Computational imaging**
