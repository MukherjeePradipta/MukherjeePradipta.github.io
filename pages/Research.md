Our group is interested in developing next-generation medical devices and computational tools to assess complex biological processes within intricate biological systems non-invasively and label-free. Through advanced engineering, we aim to achieve deeper tissue penetration, faster acquisition times, multi-functional contrasts, and automated high-throughput visualization of biological systems.

Our current research interests are the following: 
- **Label-free imaging**
- **Multi-functional optical coherence tomography**
- **Quantitative Polarization Microscopy**
- **Computational imaging** 

### Label-free imaging
Label-free imaging techniques visualize specific structures or molecules without fluorescent dyes or contrast agents, preserving the natural state of biological samples for long-term studies and clinical use. By statistical analysis of rapid-time-sequence optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals, we visualize and quantify tissue metabolic activity without any labeling agents. This approach studied the long-term activity of healthy and fibrotic liver microvasculature, revealing high dynamics in the periportal/pericentral region and tissue activity degradation over time. In a unilateral obstructed kidney model, functional pipe-like structures, likely renal tubules, were observed, but they were absent in the obstructed kidney, indicating potential loss of functionality.

### Multi-functional optical coherence tomography
Conventional optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution (micrometer), cross-sectional structural views of biological tissues. Multi-functional OCT expands the capabilities of traditional OCT by providing a more comprehensive view of both structural and functional aspects of tissues, enabling more detailed assessments of various medical conditions. Jones matrix-based polarization-sensitive OCT system can provide multi-functional information about tissue properties, such as its structural properties (OCT intensity), dynamic properties (tissue activity), angiography (blood flow information), and polarization properties (birefringence).

### Quantitative polarization microscopy
