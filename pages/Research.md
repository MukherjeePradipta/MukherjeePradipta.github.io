Our group is interested in developing next-generation medical devices and computational tools to assess complex biological processes within intricate biological systems non-invasively and label-free. Through advanced engineering, we aim to achieve deeper tissue penetration, faster acquisition times, multi-functional contrasts, and automated high-throughput visualization of biological systems.

Our current research interests are the following: 
- **Label-free imaging**
- **Multi-functional optical coherence tomography**
- **Quantitative Polarization Microscopy**
- **Computational imaging** 

### Label-free imaging
Label-free imaging techniques allow visualization of specific structures or molecules without the use of fluorescent dyes or contrast agents. This preserves the natural state of biological samples, making it suitable for long-term studies and clinical use. 

We recently introduced a label-free approach for three-dimensional visualization of cellular and tissue metabolic activity without the need for labeling agents. By employing a customized scanning protocol and statistically analyzing rapid-time-sequence optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals at the same location of a sample, we are able to visualize and quantify tissue metabolism. This method was used to study the long-term activity of healthy and fibrotic liver microvasculature, revealing high dynamics in the liver's periportal/pericentral region and degradation of tissue activity over time. Another study demonstrated the activity of renal tubule structures in normal kidneys, as well as a loss of functional activity in unilateral obstructed kidney models.

### Multi-functional optical coherence tomography
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution (micrometer), cross-sectional view of biological tissues. Multi-functional OCT expands the capabilities of conventional OCT by providing both structural and functional aspects of tissues, enabling more detailed assessments of various medical conditions. 

An example of multi-functional OCT is the Jones matrix-based polarization-sensitive OCT (JM-OCT) system. By proper signal processing algorithms, JM-OCT can provide multi-functional information about tissue properties, such as its structural properties (OCT intensity), dynamic properties (tissue activity), angiography (blood flow information), and polarization properties (birefringence).

### Quantitative polarization microscopy
