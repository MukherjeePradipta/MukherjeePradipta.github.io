Our group is interested in developing next-generation medical devices and computational tools to assess complex biological processes within intricate biological systems non-invasively and label-free. Through advanced engineering, we aim to achieve deeper tissue penetration, faster acquisition times, multi-functional contrasts, and automated high-throughput visualization of biological systems.

Our current research interests are the following: 
- **Label-free imaging**
- **Multi-functional optical coherence tomography**
- **Quantitative Polarization Microscopy**
- **Computational imaging** 

### Label-free imaging
Label-free imaging techniques offer a way to visualize specific structures or molecules without the use of fluorescent dyes or contrast agents. These labels can be invasive, potentially altering the natural state of biological processes, causing photobleaching and phototoxicity, and requiring extensive preparation. In contrast, label-free imaging preserves the natural state of the biological sample, making it suitable for long-term studies and clinical use.

A label-free imaging method based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals was recently demonstrated to visualize and quantify tissue metabolic activity. This method is based on a statistical analysis of rapid-time-sequence OCT signals at the same location. This method was used to study the long-term activity of healthy and fibrotic livers' microvasculature complex. The study successfully visualized high dynamics just after sacrifice around the liver microvasculature and showed the degradation of tissue activity through a longitudinal study. In another study on a unilateral obstructed kidney model, pipe-like functional structures were observed, which are considered as kidney renal tubules. These pipe-like structures did not appear in the obstructed kidney model, indicating a potential loss of functionality in the renal tubules.

### Multi-functional optical coherence tomography
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution (micrometer), cross-sectional images of biological tissues. Developed in the early 1990s, OCT uses the low-coherence interferometry principle to measure the time delay of light reflected from different tissue layers. It is widely used in ophthalmology for imaging the retina and cornea, and has applications in cardiology, dermatology, and oncology.

Although OCT provides high-resolution structural images, it primarily delivers information about the morphology and structure of tissues and lacks sensitivity to functional tissue properties. Multi-functional OCT expands the capabilities of traditional OCT by providing a more comprehensive view of both structural and functional aspects of tissues, enabling more detailed assessments of various medical conditions. A Jones matrix-based polarization-sensitive OCT system was developed to provide multi-functional information about tissue properties, such as its structural properties (OCT intensity), dynamic properties (tissue activity), angiography (blood flow information), and polarization properties (birefringence).
