Our group is interested in developing next-generation medical devices and computational tools to assess complex biological processes within intricate biological systems non-invasively and label-free. Through advanced engineering, we aim to achieve deeper tissue penetration, faster acquisition times, multi-functional contrasts, and automated high-throughput visualization of biological systems.

Our current research interests are the following: 
- **Label-free imaging**
- **Multi-functional optical coherence tomography**
- **Quantitative Polarization Microscopy**
- **Computational imaging**


**Label-free imaging:**
Label-free imaging techniques offer a way to visualize specific structures or molecules without the use of fluorescent dyes or contrast agents. These labels can be invasive, potentially altering the natural state of biological processes, causing photobleaching and phototoxicity, and requiring extensive preparation. In contrast, label-free imaging preserves the natural state of the biological sample, making it suitable for long-term studies and clinical use.
