I am teaching the following courses at the Centre for Biomedical Engineering (CBME): 

**BML815: Special Topics in Biomedical Engineering- Optical Coherence Tomography- Technology and Applications**   
**Course overview:**   
The course begins with the basic concepts and the history of optical coherence tomography (OCT) development. It will cover various OCT technologies, including time-domain, spectral-domain, and swept-source OCT. We will discuss the mathematical principles for OCT image reconstruction, theories of resolutions and sensitivity, and its hardware implementation. The course will also cover functional OCT technologies, such as polarization-sensitive OCT and Dynamic OCT. Finally, the course will discuss the ophthalmic applications of OCT, emphasizing the essential role of OCT in diagnosing and monitoring ocular diseases.

**BMV702: Basic Mathematics for Biologists**   
**Course overview:**   
The course covers the following topics: Graphs and functions, Complex numbers, Matrix, Determinants, Derivatives, Integration, Vector algebra, Differential equations, and Statistics. The objective of this course is to understand fundamental mathematical concepts, apply mathematical techniques to biological problems, and develop problem-solving skills to analyze and interpret biological data quantitatively.
