Welcome to **LOBO, the Laboratory of Biomedical Optics** at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.   
We are an interdisciplinary research group focusing on the biomedical optics field, combining biomedical and optical science and engineering. 
Our research interests include optical coherence tomography, microscopy, polarization engineering, and three-dimensional polarization-sensitive microscopy for label-free imaging of small animals. 
More information about our research can be found in the Research Page section.
