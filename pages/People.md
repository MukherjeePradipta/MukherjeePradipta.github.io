Dr. Pradipta Mukherjee is an Assistant Professor at the Center for Biomedical Engineering at IIT Delhi. He also holds a joint faculty position at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at AIIMS, Delhi. 
He received his first Bachelor's degree (B.Sc) in Physics (Honours) from the University of Calcutta in 2008. Subsequently, he obtained a Post B.Sc-B.Tech in Optics and Optoelectronics in 2011, followed by an M.Tech in Optics in 2013, both from the University of Calcutta. He earned his PhD in Polarization Optics from the Center for Optical Research and Education at Utsunomiya University, Japan in 2019. 
Prior to pursuing his PhD, he worked for a period of time at the CSIR-CSIO lab on an optical system design project for a head-up-display system. Post-PhD, he joined the Computational Optics Group (COG) at the University of Tsukuba, Japan, as a postdoctoral researcher from 2019 to 2024.

Dr. Mukherjee's research contributions are in the Biomedical Optics and Biophotonics fields, where he focuses on developing and applying various optical methods for label-free and nondestructive imaging of biological tissues. 
Dr. Mukherjee was awarded the Japanese government MEXT scholarship for his PhD studies. Additionally, he was selected for the JSPS postdoc scholarship, which he declined in favor of his appointment at IIT Delhi.
